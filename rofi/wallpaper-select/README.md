# Wallpaper selector

The **wallpaper-select.sh** file is called from the **$HOME/.config/hypr/conf/keybindings.conf** to present a good UI when changing wallpaper. It uses the rofi configuration **$HOME/.config/rofi/wallpaper-select.rofi**, which sources the pywal16 colors.
This script is also responsible for reloading the pywal16 colors according to the new wallpaper.

I personnaly saw this theme in HyDE's dotfiles (https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE) and took this script in Abhra00's dotfiles before mofifying it myself.
